# DL_final_project
Stock market prediction is a challenging task; it is traditionally powered by statistical time series forecasting models like ARIMA. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks that are naturally suited to processing time-series data, and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) RNNs are capable of learning long-term dependencies because of the memory functions. In this project, I created a LSTM RNN model to predict Apple stock price 5 days in advance.  The model was able to make very accurate prediction with low error, which makes it a possible candidate for real-world trading predicting framework. 

The Notebook and dataset are both uploaded into this repositoary.
